What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When you initialize a repository, Git creates the .Git directory 
that will contain all the version information.  The repository does
not contain any files at this point, they must be added.  There are no 
commits yet, either.  This step is necessary to create the basic structure 
that git needs to formulate the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area provides a place to add files to 
be committed.  This allows us to choose what to commit, 
rather than simply dumping the contents of the directory 
to the repository. This staging area is temporary, in that
the files are there only to be transferred to the repository.
This provides an orderly way to control the addition of 
versions to the repository.
