When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Collaboration.  Remote work.  Multiple computers.  Sharing.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually 
rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
There might be times when your work is not
ready for being put in the public domain.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are copied from Github to github.  This is a way
of maintaining attribution while copying someone's work
to modify for your own needs.
Clones are copies from Gitrhub to local or local to local that
represent alternate storage of your own work.
Branches are extensions of your own work that remain resident within the 
repository.  they are used to explore alternatives when coding.
