When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Collaboration.  Remote work.  Multiple computers.  Sharing.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually 
rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
There might be times when your work is not
ready for being put in the public domain.
